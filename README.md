# Testing Bazel

Bazel is an open-source compiler that can be used as alternative of CMake for C++.

More information about it and about how to install it (I am using Ubuntu 20.04) at [Bazel](https://bazel.build/start)

# Overwrite

This repository is a simple container to test the [Bazel C++ tutorials](https://bazel.build/start/cpp).

# Setup

First, to get these tutorials execute:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
